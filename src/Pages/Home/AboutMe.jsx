            Hi! I'm a nanny from Brazil, fluent in both Portuguese and English. I’ve always had a naturally calm and patient personality, which helped me connect with children from an early age. I first discovered my love for childcare when my nephew was born—I was just 12, but I loved every minute of helping take care of him.
          </p>
          <p className="hero--section-description">
            Since then, I've enjoyed supporting families and creating safe, warm, and fun environments where children feel loved and understood. Whether it’s helping with homework, playing games, or calming a fussy toddler, I bring both heart and responsibility to everything I do.
          </p>
          <p className="hero--section-description">
            Outside of childcare, I’m passionate about traveling, exploring new cultures, and collecting Rubik’s Cubes—I have over 60 of them! I love reading too, from novels to anything that helps me grow. I’m always learning, always improving, and always ready to bring joy and calm to any home I work with.
